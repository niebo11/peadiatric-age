# CoVid-19 prediction bot for preadiatric age patients
## Introduction:
The aim of this project is to create an easy to access technology capable of 
acting as a filter prior to the sanitary system for covid-19 detection in
pediatric age patients.
## Inspiration:
We try to approach children by creating a discord bot that gives them a first simple test to know if they could be positive for CoVid-19. Reactions is a special interaction that discord application has, so we try to dig into this feature to create our bot and so, make it more interactive than a common question-answer survey.

## What it does:
Our bot has basically 3 commands, with the "!covid" command being the most important one. The bot will ask the user a few questions about his symptoms and other stuff and, from the gathered data, he will try to predict a preliminary approach for CoVid-19 test.
You can also use the command "!define keyword" in order to get the proper definition of the keyword.
"!me" gives you a description of the bot.

## What's next for paediatric patient discord bot predict
More large data to get a more accurate prediction, an improvement of the bot interface so it is easier and funnier to do the survey and also make the bot more efficient and useful (such as giving the nearest CAP location in case of  positive CoVid-19 test)
